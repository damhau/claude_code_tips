# Blacklist for Claude Permission Hook
# Add tool names or patterns (one per line) that should be automatically denied
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Supports bash wildcards: * (any characters), ? (single character)
#
# SYNTAX:
#   ToolName              - Match tool name only

#   Bash:rm -rf /*
#   Bash:curl * | bash*
#   Bash:wget * | sh*
#   Bash:eval*
#   Bash:docker push --all-tags*
